1. get to know the operations

* commutative, associative, distributive
* apply the order of operations on complex expressions
  e.g. `-(5 + (-x + (-x)^2)^3) * 5` is mathematically trivial, but 
  arithmetically there's a lot of potential points for small mistakes;
  in fact most of these exercises don't need unknowns, and the 
  solution is a number
  e.g. `c^4 c^2 = c^6`, `-4d - 4 + 4d = -4`
* negatives
  * - * + and - * -
  * `-(a - b) = b - a` and `-(b - a) = a - b`
* working with powers
  e.g. `(x^3)^2` vs. `(x^2 * x^3)` vs. `(x^3 + x^2)`
       (which can be tricky, because intuitively you might
       want to reduce these different powers to a single factor,
       so metacognition is important here)
  e.g. `1/x^-3` = x^3`, `x^(-2/3) = 1/qrt(x^2)`
  e.g. `x^(1/2) = sqrt(x)`
  e.g. `a / b^3 = a * b^-3`
  e.g. what is the solution to x / (x + y^3)^2
  e.g. how can you simplify `1 / x^(-3/2)` such that it
  does not have any negative powers or fractional powers, or
  conversely, how can you write a bunch of powers and roots
  as a single fractional power
  * the difference between -x^2 and (-x)^2
  * remove square roots or negative powers from denominators
    e.g. from `1/sqrt(2)` to `sqrt(2)/2`
* extract wholes from square roots and squares
  e.g. sqrt(40) = 2 sqrt(10)
  e.g. 4x^2 + 9 = (2x)^2 + 3^2
  (Note: could do yes/no questions as well: do you think this is the correct solution? Might work well for metacognition.)

2. distributivity and other operations on polynomials
  e.g. `3(2x + 5)`, `(2x + 5) - 3`, `(2x + 5)/3`
  e.g. `(2x + 5) / (3x + 7)`
  * nothing really new, but it gets confusing really fast because you
    need to keep a lot in working memory (tricks like assigning each
    factor to a variable and then filling in work well)

3. expanding and factoring
   * binomial products: (a+b)^2, (a-b)^2, (a+b)(a-b)
     * e.g. straight-up: just expand everything you can, and simplify while you're at it
     * e.g. more involved: intelligently expand or factor to get rid of certain terms
       and simplify the final expression

4. cross-multiplication and addition/subtraction with fractions
   * a/b + c/d = (ad + bc) / bd
   * (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd
     (a + b)(c - d) = ac - ad + bc - bd
     (a - b)(c - d) = ac - ad - bc + bd
   * recognize that these apply to simpler variants too
     e.g. (a+b)(a+b) = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
     e.g. (x+a)(x+b) = x^2 + xa + xb + ab = x^2 + (a + b)x + ab
   * here too, there's straight-up exercises to see if you can do this, 
     and more involved exercises where you'll need to cross-multiply or
     factor to be able to solve the exercise


Once we're there, we get to solving first-order and second-order equations, but at that point we're beyond computational skills. Really what we're interested in here is algebra as fancy arithmetic.

In that sense, a more natural extension to the curriculum above would be

* logarithms and exponentials
* simplify expressions with sin, cos and tan
  (using sin^2 + cos^2 = 1)
* summation and product notation

But from there, it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to add differentiation and integration (it's just rules for two more operators) and equations (algebra on two linked expressions, not just one).
